    ///
    /// This "info" can only be calculated if we know the guess and the coloring which the guess
    /// produces. This is due to the definition of "info..." we must know how much of the search
    /// space is eliminated.
    ///
    /// For example, if we guess "quack" and the coloring is [🟩,🟩,X,🟩,🟩] then we can eliminate
    /// a huge number of other possible answers such as "lifts" or "rates" because the coloring
    /// excludes them (qu_ck are green and therefore the answer must contain them at that position).
    ///
    /// Because we do not know the answer, we cannot know what coloring we will get. Therefore, we
    /// cannot calculate how much info a guess will get. However, we can calculate how much info we
    /// get on average.
    ///
    /// In the above example of "quack" it's actually extremely unlikely to get the coloring
    /// [🟩,🟩,X,🟩,🟩] because very few answers produce this coloring (only example I can think
    /// of is "quick"). Although this coloring is high information, it is low probability.
    ///
    /// The implementation below tries to calculate the probability of each possible coloring.
    /// Consider if a coloring only occurs once, this means two things- it's unlikely to happen, but
    /// if it does then we gain a tremendous amount of information. The information gained and the
    /// probability of seeing a coloring are "two sides of the same coin."
    ///
    /// The probability of seeing a coloring is calculated first, then the info gained by that
    /// coloring is log2 of that probability. For example, if the probability of a coloring is 0.5,
    /// that means half the search space produces that coloring (and the other half is eliminated)
    /// giving us -log2(0.5) = 1 bit of information with a 0.5 probability.
